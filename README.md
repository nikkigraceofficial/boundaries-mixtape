The debut, 5-track, open-source mixtape by 29-year-old female Toronto rapper/producer Nicole 'Nikki' Grace.

Each track has been composed, produced and recorded within the process of seven days, through the month of June (two are forthcoming), and are being released in real-time on all major digital streaming platforms as a not-for-profit stream.

# 'Open Source Mixtape?' #

The concept is, essentially, that these tracks can serve as useful educational tools for people, as well as some good music.

With some minor exceptions due to plug-ins used, each track is presented with, what is effectively it's original Logic Pro X source file - with MIDI and uncompressed audio options for those who aren't blessed with a Mac/may just not prefer Logic.

# 'Why Logic?' #

The built-in sound library of Logic is fantastic, and provides a great starting platform for budding composers and producers to express themselves without limitations. The tracks were made and composed in Logic, and thusly the released project files are only minor deviations from the original material.

# 'Your Vocals Aren't Here?' #

I'm self-conscious. :P Furthermore, the objective of open-sourcing this is to encourage the discipline of the Craft of Production. 

# 'Can I Use [insert thing here]?' #

As long as the material is not copyrighted (e.g. the samples themselves) I encourage you to take whatever you can use from this project, however you can, for your own works (including for-profit works). Once again - as long as no copyrighted content is used, Do As Thou Will, et cetera.

# There's 3 Songs, not 5! #

They are made weekly and will continue to be released on a weekly basis. :)
